# React.js Level Two Coding Quest

## What is a Coding Quest?

- A Coding Quest is a small task or project designed to be completed within a specific time frame. It promotes learning through hands-on coding experience. This Coding Quest's purpose is to help you practice React by working out some problems in this existing app.

## Difficulty = â˜…â˜…â˜†

## What you will build:

- A weather app that tells the 7 day forecast for any city in the US

## How you will build it:

- Fix the broken search bar in `components/Searchbar.jsx`
- Swap out the lazy api (basically a dictionary) with the city->coordinates api (see `helpers.js`)
- Render WeatherCards in `components/WeatherCardGrid.jsx` by mapping over objects fed into function

## Duration:

- 30 minutes

# Instructions

## ðŸš€ Setup

1. **Clone this repo** into your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone <repo_link_here>
   ```

2. **Run it locally** by doing the following commands:

```bash
cd client
npm install
npm run dev
```

3. **Get your own API Key** and paste it in your `.env` (see `.env.example` for the exact format)
   - You need to go [api-ninjas.com](https://api-ninjas.com/api/geocoding) and sign up and get your key. It is free.
   - Don't forget to make sure `node_modules` and your `.env` are in your `.gitignore` so that your API keys aren't on the internet!!!
4. **Follow the "TO DO" comments** and the advice they give

## How do I know when my app works?

The final app should behave like this: **[Demo Video](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1JfWs0qyDIiV0wrZDZTUB6yqWc2GmsIFw/view?usp=sharing)**
